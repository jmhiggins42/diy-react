A basic React Typescript project built from scratch.

## Resources

- [Webpack docs](https://webpack.js.org/guides/typescript/)
- [Typescript docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/react-&-webpack.html)

## Windows

If you're having trouble running the scripts in a Windows environment, it might be because you're using Command Prompt or Powershell. You most likely want to use the bash shell that comes with [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads) instead. Use npm to set a bash shell for running scripts by running the follow command:

```bash
npm config set script-shell "C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe"
```
